#### Information - 

These are projects from Harvard's CS50 Web 2020 Version. This repository will contain solutions from the course and this is only made to showcase my performance
and I insist you don't copy these solutions blindly which will destroy the process of learning.

###### Note - 

This repository will also have projects from the 2018 course as I plan to do them later.
